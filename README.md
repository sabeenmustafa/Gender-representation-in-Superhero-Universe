# Gender-representation-in-Superhero-Universe

This project presents an analytical deep dive into gender representation across the superhero universe using the SuperheroDB dataset. Despite the growing popularity of female superheroes, male characters continue to dominate in both numbers and narrative focus.

I conducted this analysis entirely in **R**, using libraries like `ggplot2`, `dplyr`, and `gridExtra` to explore patterns across attributes such as power, alignment, team membership, and supernatural abilities. The goal was to highlight disparities and provide a data-driven perspective on how gender roles are portrayed in popular superhero franchises.

## Highlights

- Examined disparities in gender balance among superheroes across moral alignment and creator preferences using **R Markdown** and **Tidyverse** libraries.
- Created **Spyder, Violin, and Box plots** to compare **physical**, **mental**, and **supernatural capabilities** across gender.
- Delivered a data-driven narrative to support the conversation around gender representation in superhero media.
